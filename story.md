# TUTORIAL TOWN

Night has fallen in the neighborhood.

Let there be light.

Press Z to start the turn.

Once the turn is started, you simply have to trust.

Press Z to start the turn.

Place a poke in the right spot to push the flame towards the lamp.

Z to start the turn.

A poke next to the flame will give it a push.

Rotate it to change the direction of that push.

X to place and rotate pokes.

The flame will not move unless it is poked.

Poke the flame towards the lamp.

You can only rotate the pokes you placed yourself.

Take the long way around.

Boulders get in the way.

Get around the boulder.

The flame and the pokes have a lot in common.

Complete the path.

Pokes can also be poked.

Push away one poke to clear a path.

The flame can stop moving and wait for the next poke.

It will only die out if there is no more progress to be made.

Poke the flame towards the right so it can wait for the next poke.

The flame shimmies through.

Sometimes blocking the path is the only way.

Block its path so the flame does not go astray.

A poke can block regardless of its orientation.

Block and poke at the same time.

Pokes can serve again and again.

Make your one poke count.

Pokes should not be ambiguous.

A fickle flame needs clear directions.

You can start the turn as a way to explore.

Poke the poke that pokes the poke.

You can always press D to reset the level.

(And F to skip it.)

Try to poke from above.

No hints this time.

The neighborhood is lit up.

You are ready to wander off and spread the light.


# WINNOW PARK

The park of a thousand benches.

Every one of them
in perfect shade.

As a meeting point, the park works not at all.

As one sits and enjoys perfect shade waiting for a long-lost friend...

They might be sitting on another bench,
under another tree,
at another end of the park,
enjoying perfect shade.

The neighbors find comfort in this thought.


# SILVER HOLLOW

There is no river or stream in this hollow. Just mud here and mud there.

A kid comes to fill up his bucket before a mud fight.

Two lovers find their way here to this hollow on the first snow of the year.

A colorful viper plays strike-and-release with anything smaller than a mouse.

The coldest place in town.

Where the mud takes over and lets go like a breath.


# MAIN STREET

The dry goods store opened back when it was just called "the road".

Their door remains open to everybody even if they have no intention of buying anything.

The ice cream cart gets off the pavement and gets a storefront.

Someone pins the schedule of the sewing circle on the postmaster's notice board.

The campfire.
The crossroads.
The main street.

Where neighbors go to catch the light.


# CANNONBALL COURT

The oldest court in town.

Not a dead end but a cul-de-sac with a bulb.

As he bags groceries, the boy daydreams...

He imagines crouching in the middle of the road and then jumping up.

He takes flight.

He flies up until the neighborhood becomes a daisy.

Each house a petal for him to pick.

The last petal will decide whether he comes back down or not.
